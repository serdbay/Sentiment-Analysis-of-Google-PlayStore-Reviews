## General Information
Sentiment analysis is a very common approach performed by data analysts and data scientists in order to see the distribution of the customer reviews. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of Google PlayStore reviews. 

## Setup
We will use "google_reviews.json" data in here. 

You can find our data in our resources section. By the way you can create your own google reviews data from the google store by scraping.

## Usage
In this project our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

*Implement the new customer sections,
*Keep the old customer sections,
*Or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision in order to see their customer reviews on their product's profitability.

If you try to answer some same questions in your another customer reviews based projects, you can use this project as a template for yourself.
